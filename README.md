# FIDIA #

FIDIA (Free IRS Declarations - Income and Assets) seeks to be a free, open source alternative to
Turbotax and similar parasitic pseudo-products, designed to enable ordinary citizens to file their
US taxes electronically without paying monopolistic danegeld to worthless scam artists. The IRS has
unfortunately established a number of barriers to genuine free tax preparation software, so it is
uncertain how successful FIDIA will be in this endeavor. Feel free to contact your congressional
representatives and ask them to instruct the IRS to remove its protectionist requirements.
